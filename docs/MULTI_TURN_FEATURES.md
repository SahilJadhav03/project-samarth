## 💬 How Multi-Turn Works

### Architecture:
```
User asks Q1 → System answers with citations → History saved
↓
User asks Q2 → System answers with citations → History updated
↓
User asks Q3 → System answers with citations → History grows
↓
... unlimited questions ...
```

### Session State Structure:
```python
st.session_state = {
    "messages": [
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Question 1...",
            "number": 1
        },
        {
            "role": "assistant",
            "content": "Answer 1 with citations...",
            "raw_data": {...},
            "show_raw": False
        },
        # ... more messages
    ],
    "query_count": 5  # Total questions asked
}
```

## 🎬 Demo Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Comparative Analysis
```
Q1: "Compare rainfall in Punjab and Haryana"
→ System shows comparison with sources

Q2: "What about Maharashtra?"
→ System answers, chat history shows both Q1 and Q2

Q3: "Which has the highest rainfall?"
→ System synthesizes from previous questions
```

### Scenario 2: Deep Dive
```
Q1: "What are the top crops in Karnataka?"
→ Shows top 5-6 crops with production data

Q2: "Show me the trend for Rice specifically"
→ Focuses on Rice production trend

Q3: "How does this correlate with rainfall?"
→ Adds climate correlation analysis
```

### Scenario 3: Policy Exploration
```
Q1: "Arguments for drought-resistant crops in Maharashtra"
→ Provides 3 data-backed arguments

Q2: "What is the current rainfall pattern there?"
→ Shows rainfall data

Q3: "Which drought-resistant crops are already being grown?"
→ Lists existing crops with production stats
```

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Files Modified for Multi-Turn:

**app.py:**
- Added `st.session_state` for message history
- Implemented chat message display
- Added question counter
- Created clear history button
- Enhanced UI with chat bubbles

**query_engine.py:**
- (No changes needed - already handles any query)

**data_integration.py:**
- (No changes needed - stateless data fetching)

### Key Code Additions:

```python
# Session state initialization
if "messages" not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state.messages = []
if "query_count" not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state.query_count = 0

# Chat history display
for msg in st.session_state.messages:
    if msg["role"] == "user":
        st.chat_message("user").markdown(msg['content'])
    else:
        st.chat_message("assistant").markdown(msg['content'])

# Add to history
st.session_state.messages.append({
    "role": "user",
    "content": query,
    "number": st.session_state.query_count
})
```
